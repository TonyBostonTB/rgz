# Plain text

You can use plain text for everything. Writing technical documentation
and prose, keeping notes and making plans.

## What people use and why they should not

**Word Processors**. Microsoft Word, Pages.app, OpenOffice, and
similar apps are suitable for creating printable documents and
printing them on paper, but not for editing text. These excellent
pieces of software distract you from writing words. You rarely use
any of their features, but they slow you down.

**Cloud Services**. Google Docs, Evernote, Notes.app, etc. Cloud
services are beautiful and convenient, but the sad truth is that
there is no cloud&mdash;it's just someone else's computer. Do you
trust those corporations? You should not. They can accidentally
block your account or lose your data, and you will rarely get prompt
support&mdash;if you get *any* support&mdash;in these situations.
And what if they shut the service down? Can you transfer your data
out? Is the data format portable&mdash;can you open your files in
another app? Can you use the cloud when you are offline? If yes,
does it reliably sync your devices? Can you make backups and validate
them? How easy is it to restore?

## Why plain text?

The plain text file format is straightforward and portable. You can
open and edit your plain text files on any computer or phone. All
operating systems support plain text natively and will always support
it. You can edit your files with any text editor&mdash;no need to
convert, import or export anything. It just works. Everywhere.

Plain text files are small and easy to manage. Plain text tools are
powerful. With plain text you get superpowers of version control,
rendering to printable documents and web pages, and simple backup,
restore, and encryption.
