green to a nicer one. I simply sent him the output of 2 echo commands
with the exact characters you see in my logo now. It was a good
investment for me. I donated almost what I donate to OpenBSD each
month. Thanks Roman :)"<br>&mdash;

(2001) and briefly as my family home computer ~3.6 (2004). But kudos
to @romanzolotarev whose consistent advocacy and engagement in the
community has spurred me to move my main work laptop there for the
first time. Thx!"<br>&mdash;
