# Journey

In two and half decades I've learned a lot of stuff, but only few
things ended up being the most valuable and I'm happy to master
them till this very day, I wish I'd discovered them earlier.

Nota bene: it's all about the userland, although I've contributed
to some of these projects, but not as a developer. In reverse order
of appearance in my tool set:

  [acme-client](/openbsd/acme-client.html)

## Text editors

I switched to [vi(1)](/vi.html) for writing code, documentation,
editing configuration files, and taking notes. It works great for
me. If it's not your cup of tea, that's okay. There are many other
text editors today.

I used to use other editors as well:
[Norton Commander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander),
[Microsoft Notepad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad),
[Far Manager](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Manager),
[GNU nano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano),
[gedit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit),
[BBEdit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit),
[TextEdit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit),
and [Sublime Text](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text).

I tried
[Atom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)),
[Emacs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs),
[Coda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(web_development_software)),
[VSCode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code),
[Xcode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode),
[WebStorm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBrains#WebStorm),
[TextMate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextMate),
[Light Table](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Table_(software)),
and few others, but not longer than for few days. Maybe someday I
should try Emacs again.

I used to use
[Microsoft Word](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word),
[Pages.app](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_(word_processor)), and
[Google Docs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs,_Sheets,_and_Slides) a lot,
now I prefer [plain text](/plaintext.html).
