# GitHub Pages

Want to make your website? I suggest you start with [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It gives you full control and convenience, and it is future-proof: when
you want to move your site to your servers, just copy your files to a new
place; no lock-ins.

With GitHub Pages you can set any URL for every page. You can use your
custom domain.

GitHub Pages doesn't use databases. Nothing to configure. Your content is
a bunch of plain text files and HTML templates. It is much easier to
backup text files than databases and you can edit your pages offline in any
text editor.

You can start blogging in a minute. There's nothing to install, and you
don't need to mess around with HTML or CSS. If you don't have an account
at GitHub, all you need is your email address and few more minutes.

1. Start by forking [Jekyll Minimalist][jm] website boilerplate.
1. Write your first post and publish it.
1. Share the link with your friends. (*This* is where social media
   sites can be useful.)
