<p>Considering Vim? Looking for a good reason to switch? Vim is a powerful
and simple text editor.</p>

<p>I use Vim for writing code, documentation, editing configuration files,
and taking notes. It works great for me. If it&#8217;s not your cup of tea,
that&#8217;s okay. There are many other text editors today.</p>

<p>Nowadays I edit all text files in
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim">Vim</a> and
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>,
but I used to use other editors as well:
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander">Norton Commander</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad">Microsoft Notepad</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Manager">Far Manager</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano">GNU nano</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit">gedit</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBEdit">BBEdit</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit">TextEdit</a>,
and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text">Sublime Text</a>.</p>

<p>I tried
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)">Atom</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coda_(web_development_software)">Coda</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">VSCode</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode">Xcode</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBrains#WebStorm">WebStorm</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextMate">TextMate</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Table_(software)">Light Table</a>, and
few others, but not longer than for few days. Maybe someday I should
try Emacs again.</p>

<p>I used to use <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word">Microsoft
Word</a>,
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_(word_processor)">Pages.app</a>, and
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs,_Sheets,_and_Slides">Google
Docs</a> a
lot, now I prefer <a href="/jekyll/">Markdown and Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>So why did I switch to Vim? Why should you?</p>

<h2 id="Vim%20is%20powerful">Vim is powerful</h2>

<p>Vim has everything you may need for text editing out-of-the-box: syntax
highlighting, autocompletion, split screen, diff, spell checking, text
formatting, text objects, persistent undo, automatic commands, macros,
scripting, and many more.</p>

<p>Most of Vim features are kind of hidden and it makes sense, nothing stands
on your way when you are working. Although, such minimalism makes learning
curve a bit steeper.</p>

<p>On the other hand, everything in Vim is thoroughly documented and the
documentation is always available via <code>:help</code> command.</p>

<h2 id="Vim%20is%20keyboard-based">Vim is keyboard-based</h2>

<p>Usual Vim command is a sequence of keystrokes. You rarely use key chords
in Vim and you don&#8217;t need a mouse.</p>

<p>You can effortlessly make large edits <a href="https://vimgolf.com">with few
keystrokes</a>, because Vim has commands, movements, and
can operate text objects: paragraphs, sentences, words, etc. Everything is
mnemonic. For example, you can type <code>dap</code> in normal mode to <em>&#8220;delete a
paragraph&#8221;</em>, and <code>ciw</code> to <em>&#8220;change in word&#8221;</em>, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="Vim%20is%20extensible">Vim is extensible</h2>

<p>Vim can do a lot without any customization or plugins, but you can tailor
Vim for your needs. There are tons of plugins for Vim (you may need just
few), you can install and update them with ease.</p>

<p>Vim is well integrated with command line tools (<code>grep</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>head</code>,
<code>tail</code>, <code>tee</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>sort</code>, etc). With
pipes and redirects you can compose programs to do any text manipulations
you may need.</p>

<h2 id="Vim%20is%20fast">Vim is fast</h2>

<p>Vim doesn&#8217;t need a lot of resources <a href="https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/editor-perf">to perform
well</a>.
Its startup time is <strong>under six milliseconds</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>$ vim -u NONE --startuptime vim.log +q
$ tail -n 1 vim.log | cut -f1 -d&#39; &#39;
005.287
</code></pre>

<p>To be fair, to start Vim with a dozen of plugins and to open a file takes
about 60 ms. Still impressive.</p>

<p>Vim almost never lags and typing latency is very low.
<a href="https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer">Typometer</a> shows 4.8 ms for Vim
in Terminal.app on macOS.</p>

<p>Even when you are editing files on a remote machine over SSH and the
internet connection is slow, you still are in control, because in Vim you
can do a lot with a single command: quick jumps inside a large file,
switching among multiple files, searching and replacing across all files
in a project, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, Vim works perfectly in a terminal over SSH. You can edit files
remotely and be as productive as on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="Vim%20is%20future-proof">Vim is future-proof</h2>

<p>Vim (or its predecessor vi) is pre-installed on all Unix-like machines
(macOS, BSD, Linux). Vim has been ported to almost all operating systems,
including Windows.</p>

<p>Vim is a free and open-source software. It&#8217;s a time-tested software: vi
released in 1976, Vim &#8212; in 1991. Vim will stay around for a long time.
Once you learned Vim you may use it for decades. You workflow may change,
programming languages come and go, but Vim always does its job well.</p>

<p>Still undecided? Try Vim for a couple days.</p></div>
