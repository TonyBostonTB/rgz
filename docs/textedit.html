<p>You can use plain text for everything. Writing technical documentation
and prose, keeping notes and making plans. Usually I type my words into
Vim, but today I&#8217;m composing this page in TextEdit.app.</p>

<p>Why? TextEdit is the best way of introducing plain text to people who
just started learning or to those who only touch their computer
occasionally.</p>

<h2 id="What%20people%20use%20and%20why%20they%20should%20not">What people use and why they should not</h2>

<p><strong>Word Processors</strong>. Microsoft Word, Pages.app, OpenOffice, and similar
apps are suitable for creating printable documents and printing them on
paper, but not for editing text. These excellent pieces of software
distract you from writing words. You rarely use any of their features, but
they slow you down.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud Services</strong>. Google Docs, Evernote, Notes.app, etc. Cloud services
are beautiful and convenient, but the sad truth is that there is no cloud
&#8212; it&#8217;s just someone else&#8217;s computer. Do you trust those corporations?
You should not. They can accidentally block your account or lose your
data, and you will rarely get prompt support &#8212; if you get <em>any</em> support
&#8212; in these situations. And what if they shut the service down? Can you
transfer your data out? Is the data format portable &#8212; can you open your
files in another app? Can you use the cloud when you are offline? If yes,
does it reliably sync your devices? Can you make backups and validate
them? How easy is it to restore?</p>

<p><strong>Text Editors</strong>. When you are learning to program or just making quick
text edits, use TextEdit. As soon as you get serious about programming or
writing, you can switch to powerful text editors like Vim or Emacs.</p>

<h2 id="Why%20plain%20text?">Why plain text?</h2>

<p>The plain text file format is straightforward and portable. You can open
and edit your plain text files on any computer or phone. All operating
systems support plain text natively and will always support it. You can
edit your files with any text editor &#8212; no need to convert, import or
export anything. It just works. Everywhere.</p>

<p>Plain text files are small and easy to manage. Plain text tools are
powerful. With plain text you get superpowers of version control,
rendering to printable documents and web pages, and simple backup,
restore, and encryption.</p>

<h2 id="TextEdit.app%20is%20good%20for%20beginners">TextEdit.app is good for beginners</h2>

<p>TextEdit.app is pre-installed on every Mac and supports plain text. It is
fast, simple, and beginner-friendly. Learn it once, use it for years. You
get <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202255">auto save and versions</a> for
free. TextEdit has everything you need and has nothing else.</p>

<p>To start using it for plain text files, set these defaults.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, open TextEdit.app,</li>
<li>press <strong>&#x2318;,</strong> to open <strong>Preferences</strong>,</li>
<li>switch <strong>Format</strong> to <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: You can also adjust the default font and size by clicking on
<strong>Change</strong> beside <strong>Plain text font</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/textedit-new-document.png" alt="TextEdit.app &gt; Plain text" /></p>

<p>You can always adjust the font size in the current window with
<strong>&#x2318;+</strong> and <strong>&#x2318;-</strong>.</p>

<p>Optionally, go to <strong>Preferences &gt; Open and Save</strong>. Check <strong>When Opening a
File</strong> to <strong>Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/textedit-open-and-save.png" alt="TextEdit.app &gt; HTML as code" /></p>

<p>Now you can close the TextEdit window and open a new one in plain text.</p>

<h2 id="TextEdit.app%20is%20best%20for%20quick%20edits">TextEdit.app is best for quick edits</h2>

<p>You can write some prose in TextEdit, but editing long texts, especially
across multiple files, is inefficient. To be honest, I switched to Vim to
edit this page as soon as the first draft was complete.</p>

<p>Plain text is awesome!</p></div>
