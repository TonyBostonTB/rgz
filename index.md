## How to support this site

[Become a sponsor](/sponsors.html "24 Apr 2018").

Thank you for your support! My current goal is quite modest. I'd
like to test Patreon and how donations work for sites like mine.

<progress style="display: block; width: 100%; border: none;" value="33" max="100"></progress>
$33 of $100 per month

As soon as the goal is reached, I'll publish my roadmap.

If you're not ready to become a patron, say something nice on
Twitter, that helps too. :)
