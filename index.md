# About this site

This website is here, because I want to share with you what I've learned
as a web developer and I want **to help beginners and junior developers
to learn** same things, but **faster**.

On these pages you can learn basics of web technologies and how to build
your software development tool set with Unix-like operating systems and
command line tools.

You can expect these pages [load fast](/fast.html) even if the internet
connection is slow, all pages are just static HTML and the bare minimum
of CSS (BODY width, HR border, LI margin, IMG and TABLE width, PRE
overflow-x). To keep this site snappy and protect your privacy I avoid
embedded web fonts, tracking, analytic tools, social media buttons. Most
pages are just text.

This website has been generated with [ssg](/ssg.html), served by
[OpenBSD httpd](/openbsd/webserver.html), and hosted on
[Vultr](/vultr.html).

This project is [sponsored by you](/sponsors.html). Thank you!
