# My dear sponsor,

In 2017 I decided to document everything I learn as I go and one day [I
tweeted
](https://mobile.twitter.com/romanzolotarev/status/909807483149066248)
about [my fanless OpenBSD setup](/setup.html). You retweeted and liked
that tweet, and then
[@mischapeters](https://mobile.twitter.com/mischapeters) sent me a
T-shirt and almost at the same time
[@FiLiS](https://mobile.twitter.com/FiLiS) mailed me few stickers...

> [Mischa](https://mobile.twitter.com/mischapeters/status/910019073223872512 "19 Sep 2017"):
"Nice setup! That needs a RUN BSD shirt!"

> [FiLiS](https://mobile.twitter.com/FiLiS/status/925425396941770755 "31 Oct 2017"):
"...DM me your address and I'll send you some."

Few months later Mischa has helped me again and hosted [an European
mirror of this very website](http://hi.romanzolotarev.com/).

> [Mischa](https://mobile.twitter.com/mischapeters/status/984827416215457794 "13 Apr 2018"):
"Let me know if you need an OpenBSD VPS on VMM in Amsterdam."

That's how it all started.
