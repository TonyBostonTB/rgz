# My dear sponsor,

In 2017 I decided to document everything I learn as I go and one day [I
tweeted
](https://mobile.twitter.com/romanzolotarev/status/909807483149066248)
about [my fanless OpenBSD setup](/setup.html). You retweeted and liked
that tweet, and then
[@mischapeters](https://mobile.twitter.com/mischapeters) sent me a T-shirt
and almost at the same time [@FiLiS](https://mobile.twitter.com/FiLiS)
mailed me few stickers...

Nice setup! That needs a RUN BSD shirt!</span></div>

...DM me your address and I'll send you some.</span></div>

Few months later [Mischa](https://mobile.twitter.com/mischapeters) has
helped me again and hosted [an European mirror of this very
website](http://hi.romanzolotarev.com/).

Let me know if you need an OpenBSD VPS on VMM in Amsterdam.</span></div>

That's how it all started.
