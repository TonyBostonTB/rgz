Beep boop beep. What's up?

- In the last two months I've released and started testing my shell
scripts for memberships [1] and newsletter subscriptions [2] (work
in progress);

[1]: https://rgz.ee/bin/m
[2]: https://rgz.ee/bin/n

- this week I wrote few more scripts to send this very newsletter
to you; all these shell scripts served by OpenBSD httpd(8) and
slowcgi(8); I use curl to talk to the RESTful API of my payment
service provider and jq to parse JSON;

- moved my website to a new domain RGZ.EE, so you can enjoy shorter
URLs; yay! (the old domain name [3] will stay intact for awhile);

- I've also added a logo and updated my avatar.

Want to learn how to make a simple web service with the minimalist
tech stack: vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS on the frontend, and CGI
and shell scripts for the backend?

There are two member-only pages so far:

1. Connect to Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks from OpenBSD

2. Set up a web server with httpd(8) and relayd(8) on OpenBSD

P.S. Most of my how-tos and script are still available for free.
