<h1>Shell scripts to manage newsletters and memberships</h1>

<p>Beep boop beep. What's up?</p>

<ul><li>In the last two months I've released and started testing
my shell scripts for <a href="https://rgz.ee/bin/m">memberships</a>
and <a href="https://rgz.ee/bin/n">newsletter subscriptions</a>
(<em>work in progress</em>);</li><li>this week I wrote few more
scripts to send this very newsletter to you; all these shell scripts
served by OpenBSD httpd(8) and slowcgi(8); I use <em>curl</em> to
talk to the RESTful API of my payment service provider and <em>jq</em>
to parse JSON;</li><li>moved my website to a new domain <a
href="https://rgz.ee/">RGZ.EE</a>, so you can enjoy shorter URLs;
yay! (<a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/">the old domain
name</a> will stay intact for awhile);</li><li>I've also added a
logo and updated my avatar.</li></ul>

<p>Want to learn how to make a simple web service with the minimalist
tech stack: <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>,
<strong>CSS</strong> on the frontend, and <strong>CGI and shell
scripts</strong> for the backend?<br></p>

<p>There are two member-only pages so far:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://rgz.ee/m/on.html">Connect to Wi-Fi and
Ethernet networks from OpenBSD</a></li><li><a
href="https://rgz.ee/m/ow.html">Set up a web server with httpd(8)
and relayd(8) on OpenBSD</a></li></ul>

<p>P.S. Most of my how-tos and script are still available for free.
Please support me on <a href="https://rgz.ee/patreon.html">Pateron</a>
