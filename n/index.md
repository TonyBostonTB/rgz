# Mastering the Web &mdash; Newsletter

_Self-hosted websites.<br>
Shell scripts and text editors.<br>
How-to guides for BSD/Unix users.<br>
Tutorials for web developers._

**Why should you subscribe?** If you want to get notified when I
publish a how-to guide or release a shell script, or if you want
to know what I've learned in a month or so, then you should subscribe.

**Why not Twitter (or not other social networking services)?** I
don't like the idea that my account can be locked for no apparent
reason (happened to me and some of my friends few times already).

As software developers and system administrators we are responsible
for **keeping the web independent**. We shouldn't rely on the mercy of
corporations.

Another reason: **save your time**. Few times a month I pick the
best parts and send them to you. Stay tuned!
