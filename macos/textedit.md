# Edit text with TextEdit.app

Usually I type my words into [vi](/vi.html), but today I'm composing
this page in TextEdit.app.

TextEdit.app is pre-installed on every Mac and supports plain text.
To start using it for plain text files, set these defaults.

- First, open TextEdit.app,
- press **&#x2318;,** to open **Preferences**,
- switch **Format** to **Plain text**.

Note: You can also adjust the default font and size by clicking on
**Change** beside **Plain text font**.

![TextEdit.app > Plain text](/textedit-new-document.png)

You can always adjust the font size in the current window with
**&#x2318;+** and **&#x2318;-**.

Optionally, go to **Preferences > Open and Save**. Check **When Opening a
File** to **Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text**.

![TextEdit.app > HTML as code](/textedit-open-and-save.png)

Now you can close the TextEdit window and open a new one in plain text.

You can write some prose in TextEdit, but editing long texts,
especially across multiple files, is inefficient. Frankly, I switched
to [Vim](/vim.html) to edit this page as soon as the first draft
was complete.
