# Norman layout

I use [Norman layout](https://normanlayout.info) on [my
ErgoDox](/ergodox.html).

David (the layout's author) claims it's **46% less effort than
QWERTY** and I tend to agree. I'm still fluent in QWERTY on regular
keyboards, to reach my full speed takes a couple of minutes.

_Comparison of Norman layout with QWERTY_

- Red keys swapped hand,
- yellow keys are under another finger,
- green keys are just in a different column,
- blue keys changed their row.

Note for [Vim](/vim.html)/[vi](/vi.html) users: I don't remap any
keys and **HJKL** works just fine for me.

P.S. I still use QWERTY on regular keyboards.
