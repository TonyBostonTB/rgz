# OpenBSD on my fanless desktop computer

You asked me about my setup. Here you go.

I've been using [OpenBSD](/openbsd/why.html) on servers for years as a web
developer, but never had a chance to dive in to system administration
before. If you appreciate the simplicity of OpenBSD and you have to give
it a try on your desktop.

Bear in mind, this is a relatively _cheap ergonomic_ setup, because all I
need is [xterm(1)](http://man.openbsd.org/xterm.1) with [Vim](/vim.html)
and Firefox, I don't care about CPU/GPU performance or mobility too much,
but I want a large screen and a good keyboard.

## OpenBSD

I tried few times to install OpenBSD on my MacBooks---I heard some models
are compatible with it,---but in my case it was a bit of a fiasco
(thanks to Nvidia and Broadcom). That's why I bought a new computer, just
to be able to run this wonderful operating system.

Now I run [`-stable`](https://www.openbsd.org/stable.html) on my desktop
and servers. Servers are supposed to be reliable, that's obvious, why not
run `-current` on a desktop? Because `-stable` is shipped every six months
and I that's is often enough for me. I prefer [slow
fashion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiw3YcwGwrU).

Regarding my window manager of choice: it's
[cwm(1)](http://man.openbsd.org/cwm.1). It has tiling mode, so I don't
have to rearrange windows manually.

![cwm](/cwm.jpeg)

Here is my [.cwmrc](/openbsd/cwmrc). Quite often I keep just two windows
open. On the left side: [tmux(1)](http://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1) in
[xterm(1)](http://man.openbsd.org/xterm.1). On the right side: Firefox.

This machine is silent, thanks to passive cooling, has no moving parts.
That's cool! Right? Of course, from time to time it gets literally hot,
but figuratively it stays cool all the time. ;)

According to [sysctl(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.8) its CPU is at
50&deg;C while it's idle and up to 80&deg;C at the maximum load. It cools
down in five minutes.

Almost all the hardware is supported by OpenBSD 6.3 out-of-the-box. For
Intel network devices (LAN and WiFi) you'll need firmware binary images.
OpenBSD downloads and installs them automatically on the first boot. I've
not tested DisplayPort and USB-C, but supposed to work.

Only Bluetooth doesn't work because, well, [it
shouldn't](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=140511572108715&w=2).

_"I'm not very familiar, but the implementation had too many issues for it to be salvageable, it was treated like a network protocol which turned out to be the wrong design. Commit message suggests it also simply didn't work: <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=140511572108715&w=2">marc.info?l=openbsd-cvs...</a>"_

## ErgoDox EZ V3

The ErgoDox is a DIY keyboard project initiated by Dominic Beauchamp. The
design is ergonomic, split in two separate halves with a columnar layout.

![ErgoDox](/ergodox-ez.jpeg)
_The right half of ErgoDox EZ_

Why EZ, not DIY kit? Wrist rest and tilt kit. High quality. Excellent
service. 2-year warranty. I have chosen ErgoDox with Cherry MX Brown
switches, blank DCS keycaps, and my custom single-layer layout.

Why Cherry MX Brown? Blue switches are louder than brown; other
switches are not that good for typing. If you are not sure, browns are the
great default choice.

Why DCS? I tried DSA for a month, but during that experiment, my
accuracy was lower than with DCS. With sculpted keycaps my fingers "know"
where they are, while it is a bit harder with DSA profile keycaps to find
home row.

Why blank keycaps? When I'm typing I look at my screen, not my keyboard.

## Asus VZ249HE

I picked the cheapest 24" IPS. It happens to be light-weight (2.9 kg) with
an slim profile (7mm) and 178&deg; viewing angles. It works great for
text, but for graphics I'd recommend 4K displays.

## Kensington Orbit Trackball

First, I use keyboard a lot. Rarely touch any pointing devices, just to
select a text in the browser or make a screenshot. Okay, I make quite a
few screenshots sometimes. :)

This trackball is definitely more comfortable then Apple Trackpad and much
better than Apple Magic Mouse.

Second, I had never used trackball before I bought this one, so it's hard
to compare with other trackballs.

## Low tech

For notes I use [Field Notes 48-page Memo Books][m]. In those
rare moments when I'm away from my computer I can jot things down at the
rate of two hundred pages per year.

![Field Notes Memo Book](/field-notes-memo-book.jpeg)
_My first memo book. Circa 2012_

Another thing is [Field Notes Space Pen][s], which lasts forever: one
refill per thousand memo book pages.

![Nokia 105](/nokia-105.jpeg)
_The charger, phone, memo book cover, and Space Pen._

My main phone is [Nokia
105](https://www.nokia.com/en_int/phones/nokia-105). No internet. No
camera. No distractions. It's always on, one battery charge lasts for two
weeks.

Disclaimer: I still use Maps, Mail, Twitter, and Telegram on my old
iPhones, when I travel, because it's a bit exhausting to carry display and
keyboard too far away from my [IKEA desk][i].
