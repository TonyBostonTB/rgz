# Markdown in twenty four lines

Markdown is plain text with a few markup tricks.

    # Start a heading with one hash

    ## Start a subheading with two hashes

    Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.
    **Bold text** is wrapped in double asterisks,
    _italic_ in underscores,
    `monospace` in backticks.

        # Indented code block
        hello() { echo 'Hello'; }

    A list of items:

    - Each item is on its line
    - Lines start with `-`

    An ordered list:

    1. The first item
    1. The second item can start with `1.` too
    1. Markdown handles the numbering for you.

You can convert Markdown to HTML with [Jekyll](/jekyll.html),
[lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/), [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/),
or with the original [Markdown.pl](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
