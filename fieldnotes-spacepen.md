# Field Notes memo book and SpacePen

I use [Field Notes 48-page Memo Books][m]. In those rare moments
when I'm away from my computer I can jot things down at the rate
of two hundred pages per year.

memo book._

Another thing is [Field Notes Space Pen][s], which lasts forever:
one refill per thousand memo book pages.
