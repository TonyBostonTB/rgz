# Kensington Orbit Trackball

First, I use [my keyboard](/ergodox.html) a lot, rarely touch any
pointing devices, just to select text or make a screenshot. Okay,
I make quite a few screenshots sometimes. :)

[This trackball][k] is definitely more comfortable then Apple
Trackpad and much better than Apple Magic Mouse.

Second, I had never used trackball before I bought this one, so
it's hard to compare with other trackballs.

_Yes, I use it assembled._
