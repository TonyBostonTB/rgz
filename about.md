# About this site

This website is here, because I want to share what I've learned as a web
developer and help you to learn something new. Thank you for your
curiosity.

On these pages you can learn basics of web technologies and functional
programming. You can learn how to build your software development tool set
with Unix-like operating systems and command line tools.

You can expect these pages [load fast](/fast.html) even if the internet
connection is slow, all pages are just static HTML and CSS. To keep this
site snappy and protect your privacy I avoid embedded web fonts, tracking,
analytic tools, social media buttons. Most pages are just text.

To switch the color scheme click on <label class="light-off-button-inline"
for="light-off"></label> link. It's always in the top right corner. On
click it saves your preferences in a browser cookie, other than that no
JavaScript is required to use this website.

[Enjoy reading](/).
