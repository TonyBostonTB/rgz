# About this site

This website is here, because I want to share with you what I've learned
as a web developer and I want **to help beginners and junior developers
to learn** same things, but **faster**. Thank you for your curiosity.

On these pages you can learn basics of web technologies and how to build
your software development tool set with Unix-like operating systems and
command line tools.

You can expect these pages [load fast](/fast.html) even if the internet
connection is slow, all pages are just static HTML and CSS. To keep this
site snappy and protect your privacy I avoid embedded web fonts,
tracking, analytic tools, social media buttons. Most pages are just
text.

To switch the color scheme click on <label
class="light-off-button-inline" for="light-off"></label>. It's always in
the top right corner. On click it saves your preferences in a browser
cookie, other than that no JavaScript is required to use this website.

This website has been generated with [ssg](/ssg.html), served by
[OpenBSD httpd](/openbsd/webserver.html), and hosted on
[Vultr](/vultr.html).

This project is [sponsored by you](/sponsors.html). Thank you!
