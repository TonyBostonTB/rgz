# About

I make software for the web. Started my career as a webmaster in
the nineties, then focused on frontend and now [mastering the
Web](/n.html).

I've created this website in 2012 and kept it updated since then.

The site is hosted on [Vultr](vultr.html) and served to you by
[httpd](/openbsd/httpd.html). All pages are crafted in Markdown or
plain HTML and then rendered into a website by [ssg](ssg.html).

smiling at you. Usually I'm walking and talking. Haha, just kidding,
I'm sitting and staring into glowing rectangles most of the time
and dead serious._
