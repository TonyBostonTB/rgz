# Making the Web&mdash; Newsletter

_Self-hosted websites.<br>
Shell scripts and text editors.<br>
How-to guides for BSD/Unix users.<br>
Screencasts for web developers._

**Why should you subscribe?** If you want to get notified when I
publish a how-to guide or release a shell script, or if you want
to know what I've learned in a month or so, then you should subscribe.

**Why not Twitter (or not other social networking services)?** I
don't like the idea that my account can be locked for no apparent
reason (happened to me few times already).

As software developers and system administrators we are responsible
for **keeping the web independent**. We shouldn't rely on the mercy of
corporations.

Another reason: **save your time**. Few times a month I pick the
best parts and send them to you. Stay tuned!
