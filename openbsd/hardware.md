## FAQ

**What hardware is supported?**

OpenBSD runs on [a dozen of
platforms](https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq1.html#Platforms), but
binary packages of popular programs are availble only for
[amd64](https://fastly.cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/packages/amd64/)
and
[i386](https://fastly.cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/packages/i386/).

**What platform to choose for Intel&reg; 64-bit processors?**

[OpenBSD amd64](https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html). For example, it runs
on Core&trade; i3, i5, i7.

**What about 8th Generation Intel&reg; Core&trade; processors?**

[OpenBSD amd64](https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html) works well, but
these computers are not well supported yet. For example, they have
an issue with suspend/resume.

**Can I run OpenBSD on MacBook?**

Probably. I heard some models are compatible.

I've tried few times to install OpenBSD on my [MacBooks](/macbook/),
but it was a bit of a fiasco (thanks to Nvidia and Broadcom). That's
why I bought new computers, just to run this wonderful operating
system.

**Any known issues?**

For Intel network devices (LAN and WiFi) OpenBSD downloads and
install firmware on its first boot.

[Only few wireless
chipsets](https://man.openbsd.org/?query=wireless&apropos=1) are
supported.<br> NVIDIA&reg; video chipsets, and USB3 audio are not
supported.

Bluetooth doesn't work because, well, [it has been
removed](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=140511572108715&w=2).

"I'm not very familiar, but the implementation had too many issues
for it to be salvageable, it was treated like a network protocol
which turned out to be the wrong design. Commit message suggests
it also simply didn't work: <a
