# Fred says...

<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hi! I'm Tran Dac Anh
(known to others as Fred), a software developer working on smallholder
farmers solutions at Singapore Digital Hub of Yara.</p>

In 2015 I joined Cinarra Systems to develop UI for mobile ad
management and planning platform. Roman was leading the frontend
developers and we have been friends since.

We were working on Meteor and CoffeeScript project in the middle
of full migration into React. The resultant project in React was
the main focal point of our work at Cinarra. One, if not the best
part, was that the whole team was remote.

Working with Roman and team was my first exposure to serious React
development and also the first remote job. I came in as a
mid-level/senior engineer with Ad Tech experiences to help quicken
the pace and deliver a tight product. The team taught me a lot and
we were aligned in shipping decent products to end users. After
Roman decided to pursure other interests outside Cinarra and another
left, I took over the lead duties.

With Roman as the gel among all of us, but communication was a
breeze even for me as the only non-Russian speaker among the team
and the engineers in Russia. Roman was always the one distilling
requirements from stakeholders down to common frontend development
tasks, diagrams and made sure we understood what we were building
with follow-ups and validations. In that aspect, he shielded us
from a lot of downwards pressure and provided clarity whenever
required, either to other developers or non-engineering groups.

Roman is one of the most well-rounded engineers I've known and
worked with. He is one of the few who take KISS and DRY principles
and apply them to as many things as possible. As an engineer, Roman
has always been serious and passionate about working software while
remaining calm through the most intense situtations. His knowledge
and insights are super valuable to any projects and his code
philosophy is minimal and clean. Most developers could learn a thing
or two from this man and all Engineering Managers could really learn
from him.

Find me on Twitter, GitHub, or email me any time.&#8221;
