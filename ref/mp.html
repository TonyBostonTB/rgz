<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;I am Mischa Peters. I
am running a hosting and co-locating company out of Amsterdam as a
out-of-hand hobby, recently kicking off OpenBSD Amsterdam, and my
$dayjob is leading a team of Systems Engineers for a security
startup.</p>

<p>Roman and I got to know each other on Twitter in early 2017 and
bonded quickly due to common interests in technology, OpenBSD, and
minimalism. His musings on OpenBSD and willingness to help others
is great to see and he has quite a reach with it.</p>

<p>His launch of <a href="https://www.bsdjobs.com/">BSDjobs</a> and subsequent
&#8220;<a href="https://www.bsdjobs.com/people/">people who run BSD</a>&#8221; was great
to see and shows well his unique combination of clear and concise
writing and technical skills. Our first proper project together was
when <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam/?rz">OpenBSD Amsterdam</a> started and
Roman was willing to take care of the project&#8217;s <a href="/openbsd.amsterdam/">style
guide</a>, <a href="/openbsd.amsterdam/">logo</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from:@romanzolotarev+@openbsdams">pretty
much overall
communication</a>.</p>

<p>I have come to know Roman as a very positive, passionate, and
detail-oriented person. All qualities I appreciate a lot in people.
It is always a pleasure having discussions with Roman even though
we are miles apart.</p>

<p>You can find me on Twitter or contact me via email.</p>
