<p class="quote">&#8220;Hey! I'm Ivan Starkov, an author of a few
open source JavaScript libraries, and a software developer at
RealAdvisor.</p>

In 2015 I was looking for a job as a JavaScript developer and as
soon as tweeted about that, Roman replied and invited me to join
[Cinarra Systems](https://www.cinarra.com).

We started working together on a web application written by Roman
in CoffeeScript and powered by Meteor. I introduced my JS libraries
to the project and gradually, in a couple of years, we rewrote the
whole application in JavaScript and switched to React. I'm thankful
to Roman for the trust.

By then I was an experienced senior software engineer, but my
communication skills in English were pretty basic. Roman as a team
lead and great communicator was connecting us with the rest of the
company distributed across the globe.

Roman is one of the best managers I worked with, because he is
always calm in any situations. Now in my daily work I'm trying to
be like Roman &mdash; to be calm and friendly.

Roman is eager to learn and stays hands on with a good knowledge
of modern web technologies.  As a developer he advocates and supports
a good code culture, he sets the bar high, even higher than in any
other projects I worked with.

Feel free to email me for any questions.&#8221;
