<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Timur, a one of
founders of Leto24&mdash;a nationwide distributor and producer of
farming goods in Russia.  We&#8217;ve started working with Roman long-long
time ago, ca. 2003, when he made a web site for one of my companies.</p>

<p>We have been connected through dozens of ventures. With Roman I&#8217;m
always confident I can rely on his help: he&#8217;s always on time and
he gets things done.  He&#8217;s a rare top-notch professional who
underpomises and overdelivers.</p>

<p>Leto24 is a pretty low-tech business, but I&#8217;m glad we stay in touch
with Roman and can get his valuable technical advice.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask me anything about Roman.</p>
