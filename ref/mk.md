# Marina says...

<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;When you adore minimalism
and strive for perfection, and then you suddenly find a mentor who
is a minimalist and a perfectionist, you appear to be in a fairytail
where a wise and kind wizard leads you by the hand, showing you a
secret path you've been looking for all the time.</p>

Roman is that wizard. Another guy in his shoes&mdash;being that
skilled and experienced&mdash;might have turned up his nose at
everyone else and keep his secret path secret. But Roman, rather
than hiding it, takes you through it, lighting up the way beneath
your feet. When he doesn't share his knowledge verbally, he stays
a silent example for all developers and all people on the whole,
always being highly sympathetic and precise. He is the one to rely
on, to defer to, to learn from&mdash;not only professionally. He
literally teaches you both to code and to live, cutting the unneeded,
improving what is left.

I am a frontend developer, and I thirst for tips-and-tricks, best
practices, and a roadmap not to go astray in this wild jungle of
IT. About a year ago, in 2017, I was unbelievably lucky to meet
Roman, who has been helping me since then with strategic
thinking&mdash;and many other things.

Roman never stops himself and never lets you stop, nudging,
encouraging, and inspiring.&#8221;
