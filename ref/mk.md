# Marina says...

<p class="quote">&#8220; When you adore minimalism and strive for
perfection, and then you suddenly find a mentor who is a minimalist
and a perfectionist, you appear to be in a fairytail where a wise
and kind wizard leads you by the hand, showing you a secret path
you've been looking for all the time.</p>

Roman is that wizard. Another guy in his shoes—being that skilled
and experienced—might have turned up his nose at everyone else and
keep his secret path secret. But Roman, rather than hiding it, takes
you through it, lighting up the way beneath your feet. When he
doesn't share his knowledge verbally, he stays a silent example for
all developers and all people on the whole, always being highly
sympathetic and precise. He is the one to rely on, to defer to, to
learn from—not only professionally. He literally teaches you both
to code and to live, cutting the unneeded, improving what is left.

I am a frontend developer, and I thirst for tips-and-tricks, best
practices, and a roadmap not to go astray in this wild jungle of
IT. About a year ago, in 2017, I was unbelievably lucky to meet
Roman, who has been helping me since then with strategic thinking—and
many other things.

Roman never stops himself and never lets you stop, nudging,
encouraging, and inspiring.&#8221;
