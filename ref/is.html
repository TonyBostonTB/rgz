<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hey! I&#8217;m Ivan Starkov,
an author of a few open source JavaScript libraries, and a software
developer at RealAdvisor.</p>

<p>In 2015 I was looking for a job as a JavaScript developer and as
soon as tweeted about that, Roman replied and invited me to join
<a href="https://www.cinarra.com">Cinarra Systems</a>.</p>

<p>We started working together on a web application written by Roman
in CoffeeScript and powered by Meteor. I introduced my JS libraries
to the project and gradually, in a couple of years, we rewrote the
whole application in JavaScript and switched to React. I&#8217;m thankful
to Roman for the trust.</p>

<p>By then I was an experienced senior software engineer, but my
communication skills in English were pretty basic. Roman as a team
lead and great communicator was connecting us with the rest of the
company distributed across the globe.</p>

<p>Roman is one of the best managers I worked with, because he is
always calm in any situations. Now in my daily work I&#8217;m trying to
be like Roman&mdash;to be calm and friendly.</p>

<p>Roman is eager to learn and stays hands on with a good knowledge
of modern web technologies.  As a developer he advocates and supports
a good code culture, he sets the bar high, even higher than in any
other projects I worked with.</p>

<p>Feel free to email me for any questions.&#8221;</p>
