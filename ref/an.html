<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;I met Roman in 2008.
Back then I run one of my first startups&mdash;Neonray. It was a
cloud-based remote desktop solution, built on top of Amazon Web
Services, and Roman carried out the due diligence on behalf of an
angel investor.</p>

<p>I immediately liked Roman&#8217;s wide technological horizon and the
thoroughness with which he studies our project.</p>

<p>In just a year we already worked at JumpIDEA &mdash; an investment
project focused on seed-funding for technology startups. Together
we&#8217;d run due diligence of dozens of teams directly participating
in the formation of the early venture capital market in Russia.</p>

<p>A couple of years later we&#8217;re developing web services, file and
video sharing for the markets in Asia. In addition to overall project
management and architecting, Roman actively participated in the
creation of the user interafaces for these projects. It was almost
eight years ago, and we used quite a few innovative solutions for
those times in building the service.</p>

<p>Swoosh! &#x1F4A8; &nbsp; &#8230;six years flew by and we are working
together again on a new IT consulting project.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;ve always liked in Roman (and continue to like):</p>

<ul>
<li>his broad technological knowledge;</li>
<li>deep understanding of information technologies and
the latest trends;</li>
<li>pedantry and accuracy, especially in implementation;</li>
<li>ability to identify <em>weak</em> and <em>strong</em> points of a project;</li>
<li>ability to communicate his thoughts concisely;</li>
<li>ability <em>to listen</em>;</li>
<li>his persistency and enthusiasm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to email me.</p>
