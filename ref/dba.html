<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hi! My name is Denis and
I&#8217;m an aircraft pilot in my free time. By day I&#8217;m a software developer
at <a href="https://www.adjust.com">adjust</a>, where my team makes
software for a high-load system. It runs on 400+ bare metal fine
tuned for extreme performance machines. These days we process around
10PB monthly.</p>

<p>We started working with Roman around 2008 as a small team of web
developers making web services for our dear clients. We were focused
on multi year long projects: several projects of a different scope.
There was a quite big and ambitious one as well as a tiny one.</p>

<p>Roman covered all communications with clients, UI/UX design, and
project management. He precicely defined the scope of every stage
of each of the projects, so we could deliver smoothly and meet
client&#8217;s expectations.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great pleasure to work with Roman. He demonstrates exceptional
dedication, engagement, and professionalism regardless of tasks and
circumstances.</p>

<p>In recent years we mostly keep in touch online as we both move from
city to city and usually we are few hours flight apart.</p>

<p>You can reach me via email.</p>
