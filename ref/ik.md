# Ivan says...

<p class="f3 lh-title ni">&#8220;I met Roman in 2008, when I was
working on one of my startups.  Just after a few quick chats Roman
invited me to join JumpIDEA&mdash;a small venture capital project
providing seed funding and expertise to young startups in Europe.</p>

Those were exciting days, mostly because of the things I could learn
from Roman. Bridging business and tech worlds Roman was my role
model: a young and ambitious person.

The thing I still struggle to catch from him is his calm and
systematic approach to project management and basically all his
life.  I've never seen Roman tired, or bored, or angry. Roman brings
a lot of positive changes to any community or a project he joins.&#8221;
