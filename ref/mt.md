# Marat says...

<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hello, I'm Marat, a
software developer at <a href="https://www.freshcells.de">freshcells
systems engineeing</a>. I started working with Roman in 2012 at
adtech startup Cinarra Systems, we were very first employees and
started building and developing the project from scratch.

At first, Roman had been UI architect and engineer. He worked
remotely as a contractor and I was working as full-stack web developer
based in Russia, partially under Roman's leadership.  We were working
in different time zones, but I never felt any difficulties in
communications with him. When the company hired more frontend
developers, Roman started leading frontend team, and I completely
moved to backend development. We continued working together in
different teams on an ad campaign management platform.

Roman excels as a communicator and leader and it's always a pleasure
to discuss and solve challenging technical problems with him.

I'd like to highlight two distinct qualities of Roman. They describe
him pretty well: minimalism and aim to perfection. Those can be
traced in his personal habits as well as in a professional life.

Feel free to contact me via email.&#8221;
