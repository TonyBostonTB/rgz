<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;I met Roman when I
launched one of my early startups, Moozone&mdash;a music streaming
service, around 2008.</p>

<p>This was before the time of Spotify. At that point Roman was genuinely
interested in marketing and product development and had the experience
to share. I liked his methodical approach and desire to get involved
and help even though my venture was in the bootstrapping phase.</p>

<p>Overall it was a great learning experience for me. I remember Roman
as a true professional&mdash;passionate, hard-working, easy-going,
and creative. We&#8217;ve maintained a mutual collaborative relationship
since then.&#8221;</p>
