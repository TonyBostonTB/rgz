<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Roman and I started
working together in the late nineties at Center Group, where he was
a graphics designer, known for his immaculate taste and a very clean
approach to visuals.</p>

<p>It was no surprise that I invited Roman to join me when I started
Cinarra Systems&mdash;an advertising platform bridging the worlds
of mobile operators and brands. Roman started in 2012 as a part-time
contractor, which quickly became a full-time position leading the
UI team, based in Singapore. He built up the UI team from scratch
and managed the launch of our platform to our first customers.</p>

<p>Roman is a person of high integrity and is always a pleasure to
work with in a team.  I would highly recommend him for any opportunity
requiring knowledge of design and latest web UI technologies.&#8221;</p>
