Hello &#x1F44B; 

I'm Raman [@ksaitor](https://twitter.com/ksaitor).  I'm a developer
and founder of [Crypto Jobs List](https://cryptojobslist.com). I'm
building apps, helping solve real problems, and inspire other makers
and devs to do the same.  Recently I've inspired Roman to build
[BSDjobs](https://www.bsdjobs.com) &#x1F609;.

In 2015 Roman and I have worked together on an ad management system
for a Cupertino based tech startup [Cinarra
Systems](https://www.cinarra.com).

I was a full stack JavaScript contractor, helping Cinarra build out
web applications. I was reporting to Roman and working side by side
with him. Cinarra's frontend systems were written in CoffeeScript,
and even though I was an experienced JS developer I have not worked
with CoffeeScript before and was slightly anxious if I'd pick it
up in time.

Roman acted as an excellent mentor, guiding my introduction to
CoffeeScript as well as promoting high-standard engineering and
coding practices overall. Perhaps the simplest and clearest code
I've seen anyone produce. It's always a pleasure working with other
A players that inspire you to perform at your peak.

You can find me on Twitter or email me any questions you might have
about Roman's specific skills and experience.

Thanks,

**Raman Shalupau**<br>
