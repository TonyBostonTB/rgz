<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;I met Roman in 2008,
when I was working on one of my startups.  Just after a few quick
chats Roman invited me to join JumpIDEA&mdash;a small venture capital
project providing seed funding and expertise to young startups in
Europe.</p>

<p>Those were exciting days, mostly because of the things I could learn
from Roman. Bridging business and tech worlds Roman was my role
model: a young and ambitious person.</p>

<p>The thing I still struggle to catch from him is his calm and
systematic approach to project management and basically all his
life.  I&#8217;ve never seen Roman tired, or bored, or angry. Roman brings
a lot of positive changes to any community or a project he joins.&#8221;</p>
