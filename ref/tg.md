<p class="quote">&#8220;Hi, I'm Timur, a one of founders of
Leto24&mdash;a nationwide distributor and producer of farming goods
in Russia.  We've started working with Roman long-long time ago,
ca. 2003, when he made a web site for one of my companies.</p>

We have been connected through dozens of ventures. With Roman I'm
always confident I can rely on his help: he's always on time and
he gets things done.  He's a rare top-notch professional who
underpomises and overdelivers.

Leto24 is a pretty low-tech business, but I'm glad we stay in touch
with Roman and can get his valuable technical advice.

Don't hesitate to ask me anything about Roman.
