# Denis says...

<p class="quote">&#8220;Hi! My name is Denis and I'm an aircraft
pilot in my free time. By day I'm a software developer at <a
href="https://www.adjust.com">adjust</a>, where my team makes
software for a high-load system. It runs on 400+ bare metal fine
tuned for extreme performance machines. These days we process around
10PB monthly.</p>

We started working with Roman around 2008 as a small team of web
developers making web services for our dear clients. We were focused
on multi year long projects: several projects of a different scope.
There was a quite big and ambitious one as well as a tiny one.

Roman covered all communications with clients, UI/UX design, and
project management. He precicely defined the scope of every stage
of each of the projects, so we could deliver smoothly and meet
client's expectations.

It's a great pleasure to work with Roman. He demonstrates exceptional
dedication, engagement, and professionalism regardless of tasks and
circumstances.

In recent years we mostly keep in touch online as we both move from
city to city and usually we are few hours flight apart.

You can reach me via email.
