<p><p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m Marat, a
software developer at <a href="https://www.freshcells.de">freshcells
systems engineeing</a>. I started working with Roman in 2012 at
adtech startup Cinarra Systems, we were very first employees and
started building and developing the project from scratch.</p>

<p>At first, Roman had been UI architect and engineer. He worked
remotely as a contractor and I was working as full-stack web developer
based in Russia, partially under Roman&#8217;s leadership.  We were working
in different time zones, but I never felt any difficulties in
communications with him. When the company hired more frontend
developers, Roman started leading frontend team, and I completely
moved to backend development. We continued working together in
different teams on an ad campaign management platform.</p>

<p>Roman excels as a communicator and leader and it&#8217;s always a pleasure
to discuss and solve challenging technical problems with him.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to highlight two distinct qualities of Roman. They describe
him pretty well: minimalism and aim to perfection. Those can be
traced in his personal habits as well as in a professional life.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me via email.&#8221;</p>
