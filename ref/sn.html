<p><p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Roman was sole person
in-charge of the UI development at Cinarra Systems during the early
years.</p>

<p>I have worked with Roman on and off during this time.  He was a
consultant initially with Cinarra and later on he became our first
UI employee in Singapore in 2015. As Senior UI Architect he reported
to me during his employment with Cinarra. During his time as the
employee, he helped me grow the team in Singapore and elsewhere to
allow us to push out features and initiate a migration to React.js
and also to a newer design for our UI frontend application.</p>

<p>Roman is articulate and communicating with Roman was fairly easy
and as he spoke English without much trouble. Even during the
trying and crazy times Roman was patient and advocated a simple
design and worked with the backend engineers to get well-tested
APIs to ensure fewer surprises.&#8221;</p>
