<p class="f4 f3-m f3-l lh-title ni">&#8220;Hello &#x1F44B;<br><br>
I&#8217;m Raman <a href="https://twitter.com/ksaitor">@ksaitor</a>, a
developer and founder of Crypto Jobs List. I&#8217;m building apps, helping
solve real problems, and inspire other makers and devs to do the
same.  Recently I&#8217;ve inspired Roman to build <a
href="https://www.bsdjobs.com">BSDjobs</a> &#x1F609;.</p>

<p>In 2015 Roman and I have worked together on an ad management system
for a Cupertino based tech startup <a href="https://www.cinarra.com">Cinarra
Systems</a>.</p>

<p>I was a full stack JavaScript contractor, helping Cinarra build out
web applications. I was reporting to Roman and working side by side
with him. Cinarra&#8217;s frontend systems were written in CoffeeScript,
and even though I was an experienced JS developer I have not worked
with CoffeeScript before and was slightly anxious if I&#8217;d pick it
up in time.</p>

<p>Roman acted as an excellent mentor, guiding my introduction to
CoffeeScript as well as promoting high-standard engineering and
coding practices overall. Perhaps the simplest and clearest code
I&#8217;ve seen anyone produce. It&#8217;s always a pleasure working with other
A&nbsp;players that inspire you to perform at your peak.</p>

<p>You can find me on Twitter or email me any questions you might have
about Roman&#8217;s specific skills and experience.&#8221;</p>
