# Kirill says...

<p class="f3 lh-title ni">&#8220;I met Roman when I launched one
of my early startups, Moozone&mdash;a music streaming service,
around 2008.</p>

This was before the time of Spotify. At that point Roman was genuinely
interested in marketing and product development and had the experience
to share. I liked his methodical approach and desire to get involved
and help even though my venture was in the bootstrapping phase.

Overall it was a great learning experience for me. I remember Roman
as a true professional&mdash;passionate, hard-working, easy-going,
and creative. We've maintained a mutual collaborative relationship
since then.&#8221;
