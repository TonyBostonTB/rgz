<p class="quote">&#8220;In 2011 my friends and I were building web
application for a few long term projects, and we were lucky Denis
accepted our invitation to join the team as a frontend developer.</p>

Denis has been a CSS wizard for years and he quickly picked up
JavaScript. With Denis's help we've launched those projects and
kept them growing for few years.

Later Denis joined our frontend team in Singapore, as Senior Software
Engineer at Cinarra and after just two years on the project Denis
became a&nbsp;lead frontend developer (React, Redux, and recently
GraphQL) in the company. There is nothing impossible to Denis.

Denis is an amazing web developer: he learns fast, does his work
very thoroughly, he is super responsive and attentive to details.
He is a very calm and modest person. I'm proud to call him my friend.

You can reach me via email. Ask me anything.
