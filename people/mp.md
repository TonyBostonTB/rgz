# Roman says...

<p class="quote">&#8220;Hey! I'm Roman Zolotarev and I run <a
href="https://www.bsdjobs.com">BSDjobs.com</a>.  I&nbsp;was so lucky
to meet Mischa on my first days within BSD community. He always has
been very supportive and helpful.</p> 

In 2018 Mischa launched <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam">OpenBSD
Amsterdam</a> and I'm so thankful for his help to the community. I
appreciate a lot the tranparency, openness, and minimalist aproach
of the project. Everything just works, and it feels like magic.  As
a true magician Mischa [reveals his magic secrets in great
details](https://openbsd.amsterdam/setup.html), so more people could
follow him and run services based on OpenBSD and vmm(4)/vmd(8).

Everyone who works with Mischa notices immediately: he gets things
done. It's fun and inspiring to work with Mischa, thanks to his
great sense of humor and his deep experience.

Feel free to contact me via email or find me on Twitter and
Mastodon.&#8221;
