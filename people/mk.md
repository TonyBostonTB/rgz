# Roman says...

<p class="quote">&#8220;We met almost a year ago, when Marina was
switching her career to frontend web development. A month later she
was diving into the world of SVG and accessible web.</p>

Marina's learning pace and attention to details are impressive.
I&nbsp;believe years of professional experience with English helps
her a lot to move faster and dive deeper. All software developers
should hold a degree in English Language and Literature, because
clear communication, well structured code and concise documentation
is what our industry needs the most.

Marina is always willing to help and she is always on time. As a
web developer she goes one step further and educates her team and
stakeholders why and how to make web accessible. You can always
rely on Marina, she knows what she is doing, and she is very
responsible.

Feel free to email me any time if you have any
questions about Marina's skills and experience.&#8221;
