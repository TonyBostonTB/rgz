# Screencasts for programmers

Looking for top-notch screencasts? You are on the right page.

I like watching screencasts better than reading books or documentation.
Don't get me wrong, I love books and manual pages.

When it comes to learning a new programming language, to grasping
complex abstractions, I prefer to start with screencasts. It's easier for
me to learn from concrete examples narrated by an experienced programmer.
Learning should not be mind-bending all the time.

Another thing I appreciate about screencasts is that they give me a chance
to see industry leaders working with their tools. By looking at someone
else's screen you can make accidental discoveries and learn about tools
and techniques you never knew existed, one little thing at a time.

All the screencasts listed on this page are well made and cover everything
you need to know as a professional programmer: from command line tools and
text editors to advanced programming practices and lambda calculus.

Beware: My selection is a bit skewed to the web development world.
