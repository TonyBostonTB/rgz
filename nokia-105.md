# Nokia 105

![Nokia 105](/nokia-105.jpg) _USB cable, phone, memo book ruler._

My default phone is [Nokia
105](https://www.nokia.com/en_int/phones/nokia-105). No internet.
No camera. No distractions.

I make calls (2G only), receive texts, use an alarm clock, keep
(emergency) contacts and offline calendar. It's always on, **one
battery charge lasts for two weeks**.

Disclaimer: I still use Maps, Mail, Twitter, and Telegram on my old
iPhones, when I travel, for example.
